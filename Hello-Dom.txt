+++++++++++++++++==
addEventListener() -- browser functionality to 'listen' for actions and respond as needed.
ex: button on click should do something--keyboard inputs -- async data -> when data is being fetched by site.

document is an object provided by the DOM that enables us to access all HTML elements within a page and perform
CRUD operations on them.
ex: querySelector() returns reference to element needed ( think button or body).
..innerText . property of HTML elements to provide content between tags dynamically via DOM.
..createElement("span" or "div" ..etc) to create HTML elements dynamically using DOM.
..appendChild()..used to add HTML elements dynamically to existing page. 
SEE FILE dom1.html for practical use of all these.

+++NODELIST AND HTMLCollection+++
Both are representations of array but have none of the functionality of arrays. 
length property present which can be used in conjuction with a loop to access their elements using indices.

insertBefore depends on properties of parent node and reference node .
    ex: ul is parent , element7 is new node to be added and elemen8 is reference before which new is to be added. 
        ul.insertBefore(element7 , element8);

All HTML elements are node but not vice versa

+++++++++=Difference in Sibling Nodes & Sibling Elements +++++++++++++++++
previousElementSibling -> HTML elements only
nextElementSibling  -> HTML elements only
previousSibling -> previous node ( ex comments )
nextSibling-> next node( comment / text / newline etc..)


+++++EVENT PHASES+++++

Target:Element which triggers event listener
CurrentTarget: Element on which event listener is attached.

Events -> Phases , properties and propagation

PHASES ==>0 NONE, 1 CAPTURING -> 2 TARGET -> 3 BUBBLING
event starts from document(root). If listener finds same event on its path, it triggers it as well.


PROPAGATION : flow
stopPropagation():
stopImmediatePropagation():

+++++++++WINDOW SIZING SCROLLING +++++++++++

scroll(x,y)
scrollTo(x,y)

these 2 are same ---  work as absolute.

scrollBy(x,y) -- relative

scrollIntoView() -- scroll to an element in the page. -- true and false in parameter --- 
true means element will be at top -- false means element will be at bottom

getBoundingClientRect() -- The getBoundingClientRect() method returns the 
        size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.

e.preventDefault() is used to prevent default functionality of a tag / element.
for ex; in dom23 it is used to prevent form tag function of talking to a backend as there is no backend there.
also used in shift caps lock to prevent input in either case.

SEE dom24 to implement media queries without using media queries.

dom25 is countdown timer that uses setInterval to perform some funciton repeatedly in some intervals...it returns an id 
which can then be sent to clearInterval() to stop the process. Both of them are in-built browser functions.
