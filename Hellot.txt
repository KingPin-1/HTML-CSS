<!DOCTYPE html> tells the type of document
HTML Elements or tags encloses HTML code/
Important tags <html> <head> and <body> and <title>
<head> stores important meta info about the page.
<title> is within head and stores title of the page.
<style> is also within head and helps with styling our HTML elements
<body> tag encloses all the actual content.
h1 to h6 are different heading tags with different sizes.

HTML elements have attributes that upon modification give different behavior.
anchor tags used for hyperlinks in page.
div tags for division of code so that we can make them into separate blocks.

<span> is also like div + p but some differences are. ...

<img width="30%" src="W12.png" alt="44 Merc"> The alt here is used when a image is big and takes too much time to load.
gives an idea without seeing the actual img. Good to add but not necessary.

<label for="dtl"></label> gives label the for attribute takes an id.
<input type="datetime-local" id = "dtl"> id is unique and represents a unique HTML elements.

accessing elements:
    # to access by id
    . to access by class

3 types of selectors:
    Simple Selectors -- By name, id(#) , class(.)'
    Combinator Seletors -- (SPACE " ") , (> immediate) , (+ immediately next sibling) , (~ All siblings)

+++CSS UNITS++

Absolute -- px - pixels -not scalable.

Relative -- rem , em ,  vh ,vw
    rem -- relative to HTML doc font style .. 1 rem 16 px
    em -- relative to itself .. if not available..goes to parent
    vh -- relative to viewport height 
    vq -- relative to viewport width
    % == relative to parent

+++BOX MODEL+++

content -> padding -> Border -> Margin. Render engine treats HTML elements like rectangles.
padding is space around content
margin is spacea around HTML element

+++Display+++
All HTML elements have a default display attribute to allow for layout manipulation.
Block level elements (div , h1, h2 ,) occupy all available space
inline level elements (span , a , img) require space as needed.


+++CSS POSITIONING+++
STATIC -- by default every HTML element is static
Relative --  TopLeftBottomRIght has an effect , natural flow remains
Absolute -- TLBR has their effect, natural flow breaks
FIXED --same as Absolute but scrolling has no effect
STICKY -- hybrid of relative and fixed...concept of CONTAINER AND ELEMENT --- element which is sticky is 
    within a CONTAINER

+++FLEXBOX+++

FLEXBOX aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align 
and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

Space Distribution
Allignment
Responsive

flex-direction ->row , row-reverse , column , column-reverse.
align-items ... perpendicular to main axes manipulation(CROSS AXES)(flex-start , flex-end , center etc )
justify-content ... along main axes manipulation(flex-start , flex-end , center , space-around , space-between etc )
flex-flow:
order:1

 align-content determines the spacing between lines, while align-items determines how the items as a whole are 
 aligned within the container. When there is only one line, align-content has no effect.
